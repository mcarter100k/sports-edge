## 2026-10-21 — Phase 1 specs: source facts

- VERIFIED (live call): `GET https://external-api.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2/series?category=Sports`
  with no credentials returned HTTP 200 and 4,029 series. Fee pairs:
  quadratic/1 = 3,904, quadratic_with_maker_fees/1 = 106, quadratic/0.5 = 18,
  quadratic_with_maker_fees/0.5 = 1. No `flat`.
- OBSERVED (live scan): 8,325 open sports events, 93,241 open sports
  markets, 16,385 resolving within 48 h (by the earlier of expected
  expiration and close time). 2,449 events have competition_scope `Game`.
- OBSERVED: `GET /markets?min_close_ts=…&max_close_ts=…` across all
  categories returned HTTP 504. The design does not depend on it.
- NOT READ: the Kalshi fee schedule PDF (HTTP 429 to every automated
  fetch). The 0.07 taker coefficient is pinned by the docs' fee-rounding
  worked example. See `docs/specs/fee_model_spec.md` open items.
