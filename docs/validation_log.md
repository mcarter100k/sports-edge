Append-only. A correction is a new dated entry; earlier entries are never
rewritten. Statuses: VERIFIED, OBSERVED, INFERRED, PENDING, NOT CHECKED.

## PENDING LIVE CONFIRMATION

## 2026-10-21 — Phase 1 specs: source facts

- VERIFIED (live call): `GET https://external-api.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2/series?category=Sports`
  with no credentials returned HTTP 200 and 4,029 series. Fee pairs:
  quadratic/1 = 3,904, quadratic_with_maker_fees/1 = 106, quadratic/0.5 = 18,
  quadratic_with_maker_fees/0.5 = 1. No `flat`.
- OBSERVED (live scan): 8,325 open sports events, 93,241 open sports
  markets, 16,385 resolving within 48 h (by the earlier of expected
  expiration and close time). 2,449 events have competition_scope `Game`.
- OBSERVED: `GET /markets?min_close_ts=…&max_close_ts=…` across all
  categories returned HTTP 504. The design does not depend on it.
- NOT READ: the Kalshi fee schedule PDF (HTTP 429 to every automated
  fetch). The 0.07 taker coefficient is pinned by the docs' fee-rounding
  worked example. See `docs/specs/fee_model_spec.md` open items.

## 2026-10-22: GAP_v2 amended in place before any live run

- Change: the book last-update age is no longer a gate. It remains a
  record-only field (`book_update_age_s`) on every row. The only staleness
  gate is the reference fetch age ≤ 15 min. The `book_line_stale` skip is
  removed.
- Why amended in place: GAP_v2 has written no live rows (no live ledger
  exists; launchd is not installed), so no evidence carries the earlier
  definition. Owner-directed.
- Evidence for this change: see the run report of 2026-10-22 (suite result
  and the mutation test that re-adds the gate).

## 2026-10-22: daily digest report (Part A) built; scheduling not built

- **Built:** `sports_edge/digest.py` (not on the protected list), per
  `docs/specs/daily_digest_spec.md` Part A and its amendment. **Not built:**
  the 7:30 AM launchd plist and wrapper (Part B). Those are protected and
  wait for owner review. The request's premise ("not a protected-file
  change") holds for Part A only.
- **Gate 1:** 11 digest tests, plus 1 fee test pinning that
  `quadratic_with_combo_maker_fees` fails closed against a table without a
  maker fee.
- **Mutation checks:** 13 digest mutants and 1 fee mutant, each killed and
  each reverted byte-identical.
  - The first window-edge mutant survived. Shifting both edges swapped
    which boundary row counted, so the total did not change. The test was
    made asymmetric (two games at the start edge, one at the end) and all
    three edge variants are now killed.
  - A test fixture used `fee_unknown` where the run summary writes
    `skip_fee_unknown`; it was corrected before the mutant that adds fee
    skips to "Skipped" was run.
- **Gate 2 (reality, `scripts/reality_run.py`):**
  - A real read-only snapshot found 8,343 games, 93,288 markets and 22
    categories, with 0 live files changed and no failure markers.
  - The digest at the real time printed "no snapshot run finished
    yesterday", which is true: the only run was today.
  - With the clock moved forward 24 hours, the first version showed two
    definition faults. Both were corrected in the spec amendment.
  - Final output on real data: every zero names its cause (no matched
    games, no fee table, grader never run, nothing checked, odds not
    configured). A second run the same day wrote `_2` and left the first
    report unchanged.
- **NOT CHECKED in reality:** the populated money, closing-price and
  bets-spotted lines. They need an odds key, a fee table and graded rows,
  none of which exist yet. Only Gate 1 covers them.
